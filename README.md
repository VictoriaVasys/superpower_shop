# Little Shop of Orders

Little Shop is a Turing School of Software & Design Module 2 Group Project. We were required to use Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

### Learning Goals

* Use TDD to drive all layers of Rails development including unit and integration tests
* Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
* Practice mixing HTML, CSS, and templates to create an inviting and usable User Interface
* Differentiate responsibilities between components of the Rails stack
* Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
* Practice an agile workflow and improve communication skills working within a team

### Details
Our e-commerce platform sells hypothetical superpowers.

* Visitors of the site can browse superpowers and add them to their briefcase

* Authenticated users can complete the purchasing process by "buying" the superpowers in their briefcase

* Admins can view each users orders and mark them as "paid" and "completed". They can also see all of the orders in the system and their status(i.e ordered, paid, completed, cancelled).
